# Edege-detection-enhancement-using-bilateral-filter
Digital Image Processing Course project. Edge detection of Satellite images are done. Implemented using Bilateral and Gaussian Filtering and then edges are extracted by using Frei Chen, Canny and Robert operator.


Satellite imagery is vital for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster response, but its effectiveness hinges on
accurate edge detection. Unfortunately, atmospheric interference, sensor noise, and cloud cover often obscure critical features.
Traditional Gaussian filters reduce noise but over-smooth edges, blurring important geographical details. Current methods
struggle to distinguish true boundaries from artifacts, limiting their reliability.
Bilateral filtering offers a smarter solution—preserving edges while cleaning noise. Unlike conventional approaches, it adapts
to the image’s natural structure, maintaining clarity where it matters most. Our work explores this advantage, comparing bilateral
and Gaussian filtering across multiple edge detection operators to determine the best approach for satellite imagery.


The primary goal of this project is to develop an optimized edge detection framework specifically tailored for satellite
imagery. The framework must effectively preserve geographical boundaries while reducing noise, outperform conventional
Gaussian filtering approaches, and provide the best quantitative evaluation using multiple edge detection operators. In addition,
the solution should maintain computational efficiency to handle large-scale satellite image processing tasks.
The proposed approach addresses the limitations of existing methods by taking advantage of the edge-preserving properties
of bilateral filtering. Through systematic evaluation against Gaussian filtering using Roberts, Canny, and Frei-Chen operators,
we aim to establish a robust methodology that improves edge detection accuracy while maintaining computational practicality
for real-world applications.

The methodology follows a structured pipeline, beginning with image acquisition, preprocessing, edge detection, and
evaluation.
